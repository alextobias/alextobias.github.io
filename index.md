## 👋 Hi! My name's Alex. 

I'm a fourth-year computer science student at the University of Toronto. This site is primarily for people to find out a little more about me. 

I recently interned at [Akuna Capital](http://akunacapital.com/), working on the firm's trade activity monitoring and post-trade evaluation systems. 

Earlier this year, I also interned at [Asana](https://asana.com), where I worked on our Kubernetes tooling to improve our staging deployment speeds.

Last year, I was a research intern at the University of Pennslvania, working with the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](https://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/) to apply machine learning on MOOC data.
