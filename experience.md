# Where I've Worked

---

## Akuna Capital
*Incoming; Summer 2022*

I'll be working at [Akuna Capital](http://akunacapital.com/) as a Software Development Intern from June to August 2022.

## Asana
*Incoming; Winter 2022*

I'll be working at [Asana](https://asana.com/) as a Software Development Intern from January to April 2022.

## üéì University of Pennsylvnia, Center for Learning Analytics
*May 2021 - Present*

I'm currently undergoing a research internship at the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](https://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/), under [Dr. Ryan Baker](https://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/ryanbaker/index.html).

I'm a contributor to [MORF](https://educational-technology-collective.github.io/morf/), the MOOC Replication Framework. Reproducibility studies on MOOC data analytics have shown inconsistent results, which MORF aims to fix by providing a standardizing framework.

## üêù FlyFarm Agritech
*May 2020 - Aug 2020*

FlyFarm is an agritech startup aiming to bring environmentally-conscious, highly automated vertical farming and waste up-cycling to the world.

I architected and deployed a distributed network of monitoring sensors for our operations team in Australia. I wrote and deployed programs on our facility computers to interface with the sensors via Bluetooth, relay the data over an MQTT network, and upload to our AWS Elasticsearch cluster. I connected our AWS backend to our Grafana visualizer, and wrote a web client application for end-users to manage the tracking and identification of each individual sensor node. 

This was a project I had full ownership over from start to finish, and the result remains a core component of the company's FAMS product to this day.

## ü¶ø Bionik Laboratories, Inc.
*Jan 2019 - Apr 2019*

At Bionik Labs, I worked on the software for an early-stage rehabilitative prototype. Specifically, I worked with FreeRTOS running on an STM32 microcontroller. (Other info about this project is under an NDA.)

For our InMotion product line, I developed tools to help our team experiment with adding AMQP and RabbitMQ messaging features. I also took ownership of our hardware upgrade plan, and wrote automated benchmarking tests to assess graphical and computational performance across different components and configurations.
 
## üîê Isolated Electronics
*Jun 2018 - Aug 2018*

Isolated Electronics is a startup building digital tools for personal data security. 

I joined Isolated Electronics in its first stages, doing a lot of early-stage research & development and technical exploration.
I built the first prototypes of IsoKey, Isolated Electronics' digital security product, built off of open source hardware and software. 

On the business side, I helped plan the company trajectory and product goals, and took part in investor pitch meetings to raise early capital. I'm grateful for the technical and business experience I gained in building an early-stage startup.

## üéì University of Waterloo, Vision & Image Processing Lab
*Jan 2018 - Apr 2018*

I worked under Dr. Robert Amelard at the University of Waterloo Vision and Image Processing Lab, to assist in his research of heart arrhythmia detection.

I worked with Python to interface with the PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and extract ECG recordings of Arrhythmia patients. The program I created processed this data to identify the timing and types of occurring arrhythmic heartbeats in the signals, which was fed to a neural network for further analysis.

## üß¨ Synaptive Medical
*Sep 2017 - Dec 2017*

## üéì National University of Singapore, Institute of Systems Science
*Jan 2017 - Apr 2017*
