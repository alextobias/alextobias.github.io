# Where I've Worked

---

## 🎓 University of Pennsylvnia, Center for Learning Analytics
*May 2021 - Present*

I'm currently undergoing a research internship at the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](https://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/), under [Dr. Ryan Baker](https://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/ryanbaker/index.html).

I'm a contributor to [MORF](https://educational-technology-collective.github.io/morf/), the MOOC Replication Framework. Reproducibility studies on MOOC data analytics have shown inconsistent results, which MORF aims to fix by providing a standardizing framework.

## 🪰 FlyFarm Agritech
*May 2020 - Aug 2020*

FlyFarm is an agritech startup aiming to bring environmentally-conscious, highly automated vertical farming and waste up-cycling to the world.

I designed and deployed a network of environmental sensors for use by our operations team. I deployed code on our facility computers to interface with the sensors via Bluetooth, relay the data over an MQTT network, and upload to our AWS Elasticsearch cluster. I connected our AWS backend to our Grafana visualizer, and wrote a web client application to manage the tracking and identification of each individual sensor. 

This was a project I had full ownership over from start to finish, and the result remains a core component of the company's operations to this day.

## 🦿 Bionik Labs
*Jan 2019 - Apr 2019*

At Bionik Labs, I worked on the software for an early-stage rehabilitative prototype. Specifically, I worked with FreeRTOS running on an STM32 microcontroller. (That's about all I'm permitted to say for that project.)

For our InMotion product line, I developed tools to help our team experiment with adding AMQP and RabbitMQ messaging features. I also took ownership of our hardware upgrade plan, and automated benchmarking tests to assess graphical and computational performance across different component parts.
 

## 🎓 University of Waterloo, Vision & Image Processing Lab
*Jan 2018 - Apr 2018*

I undertook a project for Dr. Robert Amelard at the University of Waterloo Vision and Image Processing Lab, to assist in his research of heart arrhythmia detection.

I wrote a program in Python to interface with the PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and extract ECG recordings of Arrhythmia patients. My program processed this data to identify the timing and types of occurring arrhythmic heartbeats in the signals, which was fed to a neural network for further analysis.

## 🧬 Synaptive Medical
*Sep 2017 - Dec 2017*

## 🎓 National University of Singapore, Institute of Systems Science
*Jan 2017 - Apr 2017*
